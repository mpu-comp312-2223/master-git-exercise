Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files,
usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively
developing source code during software development. Its goals include
speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

Git was originally authored by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of
the Linux kernel. As with other distributed version control systems, 
and unlike most clientâ€“server systems, every Git directory on every computer
is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full
version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central
server. (Excerpted from Wikipedia)
